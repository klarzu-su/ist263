    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Kaitlyn L. Arzu and I’m a first-year Television, Radio, and Film major interested in post-production. On campus, I’m currently a member of the Cuse Krew club and a crew and social media member of SU’s Live From Studio B. I also work as a crew for Student Engagement and ITS’ LEMP studio.

        Outside school and work, I like playing video games and listening to music. Currently, my favorite genre of music is pop/K-pop. In terms of video games, some of my favorites include Minecraft and Five Nights at Freddy’s. I have an older brother and sister-in-law, as well as a nephew who’s turning 6, and I enjoy showing him new games. The only way I can beat him is if he doesn't know how to play, otherwise, he’s usually better than me.
