        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Kaitlyn L. Arzu and I’m a first-year <strong>Television, Radio, and Film major</strong> interested in post-production. On campus, I’m currently a member of the Cuse Krew club and a crew and social media member of SU’s Live From Studio B. I also work as a crew for Student Engagement and ITS’ LEMP studio.

            Outside school and work, I like playing video games and listening to music. Currently, my favorite genre of music is pop/K-pop. In terms of video games, some of my favorites include:

                <li>Astroneer</li>
                <li>Valorant</li>
                <li>Phasmophobia</li>
            </ul>

            I have an older brother and sister-in-law, as well as a nephew who’s turning 6, and I enjoy showing him new games. The only way I can beat him is if he doesn't know how to play, otherwise, he’s usually better than me.
